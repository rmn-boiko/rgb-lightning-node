# @utexo/minimal-gateway

TypeScript API gateway in front of ONE shared RLN instance. It owns per-user auth,
per-user FIFO queues with a global concurrency cap, idempotency keys on money-moving
routes, per-user **watch-only** rgb-lib wallets for PSBT preparation, a capped-float
ledger for the custodial LN working balance, and the user↔resource scoping map. Every
RLN list/get response is filtered through that map before leaving the gateway — RLN
state is node-wide and is never proxied raw.

Design authority: `docs/design/minimal-sdk-and-lightweight-rln.md` (repo root). Trust
invariants: no secret ever reaches the gateway (I1), one watch-only wallet per user
(I2), no cross-user visibility (I3), only the gateway holds the RLN credential (I4).

## Running

Requirements: Node 20+, pnpm, and a platform with a published rgb-lib native module —
`linux-x64`, `linux-arm64` or `darwin-arm64` (`src/wallets/rgblib.ts`). Elsewhere the
gateway still starts, but every wallet operation fails at first use with
`rgb-lib native module unavailable`.

```sh
RLN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3101 \
ESPLORA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 \
RGB_PROXY_URL=rpc://127.0.0.1:3000/json-rpc \
GATEWAY_SQLITE_PATH=/var/lib/minimal-gateway/gateway.sqlite \
GATEWAY_WALLETS_DIR=/var/lib/minimal-gateway/wallets \
GATEWAY_WALLET_INDEXER_URL=127.0.0.1:50001 \
GATEWAY_OPERATOR_TOKEN=<random, 16+ chars> \
node dist/main.js   # or: pnpm --filter @utexo/minimal-gateway start
```

The production entrypoint (`src/main.ts`) runs `loadConfig` → `buildServer` with the
background workers (deposits watcher + payments reconciler) → `listen`. `buildServer`
starts the workers only when called with `startWorkers: true` — `main.ts` does this; a
library embedding must opt in explicitly.

Users are created by the operator via `POST /v1/users` (guarded by the operator token);
the response contains the user's opaque bearer token exactly once — only its hash is
stored.

## API

Auth is one of: the operator token (`x-operator-token` header), the user's bearer token
(`Authorization: Bearer <token>`), or none. Money-moving routes additionally require an
`Idempotency-Key` header (400 without it): a replay of the same key **and** the same
request body returns the stored response, and completed rows are garbage-collected after
7 days.

Two details matter for retries. Responses with status ≥ 500 or 429 are deliberately
**not** cached — the claim is released so the request can be retried — and an in-flight
claim whose request never stored a response is reclaimable after 15 minutes, but only by
a retry of the _same_ request (a different body under that key is always 409
`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`). After a 5xx on `/v1/ln/pay` or `/v1/ln/withdraw` the retry is
therefore answered by the flow's own replay guard rather than by a cached body: the
gateway reports the recorded state instead of sending again, because it never
auto-retries a send.

### Errors

Every error response is `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`. Notable codes:

| Code                                     | Status    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Recovering a lost on-chain completion

`complete` can leave a client without an answer: a client-side timeout, a crash, or the
502 `COMPLETE_AMBIGUOUS` the gateway returns when the wallet fails _after_ rgb-lib may
already have broadcast (rgb-lib broadcasts before it writes its bookkeeping). The
operation row is the durable record of what happened, and
`GET /v1/onchain/operations/:opId` reads it back.

```jsonc
{
  "opId": "…", "kind": "send_btc",
  "state": "pending",              // pending | completed | expired
  "txid": "…",                     // final when completed; possibly-broadcast otherwise
  "mayHaveBroadcast": true,        // state != completed AND a txid is recorded
  "intent": { … },                 // the same summary prepare returned
  "createdAt": 1700000000000, "expiresAt": 1700000900000
}
```

Three properties worth relying on. It takes **no** `Idempotency-Key` and is not queued
behind the per-user wallet work, so it answers even while the `complete` you are asking
about is still running — safe to poll. It never echoes the PSBT; the client already holds
it from `prepare`. And an operation belonging to another user is reported as `404
OP_NOT_FOUND`, identical to one that does not exist (I3).

Expiry is **derived** on read, never written: an op past `expiresAt` reports `expired`
here while the stored row stays `pending` until `complete` flips it. Note the last row of
the table — an op that expires while ambiguous can no longer be completed (`complete`
answers 410), so its bookkeeping stays unfinished even though the transaction may be
confirmed. Raising `GATEWAY_ONCHAIN_OP_TTL_SECONDS` above the worst-case wallet stall is
the mitigation today.

## Deployment note: RLN is gateway-only

RLN is single-tenant and its API is node-wide: anyone who can reach it can see and move
everything. It must therefore be reachable **only from the gateway** — bind it to
localhost on the same host, or keep it on a private network segment with the gateway as
the sole peer. **Never expose RLN publicly.** The gateway holds the only RLN credential:
either a biscuit admin token (`RLN_ADMIN_TOKEN`), or RLN runs with
`--disable-authentication`, which is acceptable strictly on localhost behind the gateway
(invariant I4). The same applies to the esplora and RGB-proxy endpoints the node uses.

**RLN must not run with `--reuse-addresses`** (nor `reuse_addresses = true` in its
`config.toml`). The deposits watcher attributes on-chain funds by address, so every
deposit intent needs an address no earlier intent has used; a reused address would let
one payment credit several users' ledgers. The gateway refuses such an intent with 502
`DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_CONFLICT` — seeing that code means RLN is misconfigured. RGB deposit
intents are held to the same rule on the `recipient_id` the node blinds for them, for
the same reason (the watcher attributes RGB by recipient id).

## Float-cap tuning

The LN working balance is custodial (see the custody boundary below), so the caps are
the loss bound: `GATEWAY_FLOAT_CAP_PER_USER_MSAT` bounds what any one user can lose if
the node or gateway is compromised, and `GATEWAY_FLOAT_CAP_GLOBAL_MSAT` bounds the total
custodial exposure of the deployment. Caps are enforced where new custodial exposure is
created — deposit prepare and invoice creation, counting pending intents so parallel
prepares cannot overshoot — while settlement credits and refunds are never blocked
(refusing them would strand funds the node already holds).

**The caps cover BTC only.** They are denominated in msat and are checked on the BTC
legs alone — `POST /v1/ln/deposit/prepare {kind:'rgb'}` and the `assetAmount` of an asset
invoice pass no headroom check, so RGB units enter the custodial float unbounded (only
the msat HTLC carrier of an asset invoice is capped). There is no meaningful common
denomination to cap heterogeneous RGB assets against, so per-asset ceilings are deferred
rather than guessed; until they land, the loss bound above is a bound on custodial
_bitcoin_, and RGB custodial exposure must be monitored out of band.

One consequence is worth stating plainly: the cap is checked against the amount
_declared_ at deposit-prepare time, while the watcher credits what actually confirmed on
chain. A user who declares a small deposit and then over-funds the returned address is
credited the full confirmed amount, so the caps bound _accepted intents_, not the
absolute custodial total. Refusing the excess would strand funds the node already holds,
so the trade-off is deliberate; monitor for it rather than relying on the cap alone.

Start small: set the global
cap to what the operation can afford to lose outright, the per-user cap to a routine
spending balance (defaults: 0.01 BTC per user, 0.1 BTC global), and revisit after
load-testing real usage. The global cap must also stay below the node's actual outbound
channel liquidity, or deposits will be accepted that cannot be spent.

## The custody boundary, honestly

Quoted verbatim from `docs/design/minimal-sdk-and-lightweight-rln.md`:

> Client-held keys cover **at-rest user funds**: on-chain BTC and RGB allocations on user
> UTXOs cannot move without a client signature (for RGB, subject to the send-time limitation
> above). They do **not** cover the Lightning working balance — an LN protocol constraint,
> not an implementation gap: channel funds are controlled by the channel keys and the shared
> node is their single owner, so balances inside its channels (in-flight HTLCs, routed
> float, funds awaiting sweep) are custodial.

The "send-time limitation above" it references, also verbatim:

> Stated limitation — **send-time trust for RGB state**. The opret commitment bytes are
> opaque to the client, and in RGB the bitcoin-level spend of a colored input _is_ the
> authorization of whatever transition the server committed to it. The checks above verify
> all _bitcoin-value_ movement, but a compromised server can reassign **every RGB
> allocation on the spent inputs — amount sent and change alike — to seals it controls**,
> and such a transfer validates fine at its recipient: redirection (theft), not merely a
> burn, and the client cannot bound it (the server does coin selection). So RGB is safe
> **at rest** — nothing moves without a client signature — while every server-prepared
> colored spend exposes its inputs' allocations. Interim controls are server-side (hardened
> wallet service, independent consignment audit); removing the trust means shipping RGB
> validation client-side, i.e. the wasm variant.

Of the mitigation table, this gateway implements the first row (the capped float);
the rest are deliberately deferred (see the workspace README).

## Known limitations

- **Synchronous wallet FFI.** rgb-lib wallet calls are synchronous native FFI on the
  main thread — a slow indexer round-trip stalls all requests while it runs. Moving
  wallet calls onto a worker-thread pool is future work.
- **Fee subsidy.** LN routing fees and on-chain withdrawal fees are paid by the node,
  not debited from user balances — an operator subsidy whose exposure is bounded by the
  float caps. The _value_ the node pays out is not subsidized: an RGB withdraw to a
  `wvout:` recipient debits `witnessAmountSat` (in msat) from the caller's BTC float,
  because rgb-lib funds that new output from the node's on-chain wallet into a script the
  caller names — a withdraw the caller cannot cover answers 409 `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`.
- **One-shot deposit crediting.** A deposit intent expires after
  `GATEWAY_DEPOSIT_TTL_SECONDS`, and each intent credits exactly once — on the first
  confirmed poll. Later payments to the same address are not credited; prepare a fresh
  deposit per payment.
- **Ambiguous withdrawals need manual resolution.** The reconciler drives LN _payments_
  to a terminal state but does not cover the `withdrawals` table. If RLN times out or
  answers 5xx mid-`/sendbtc`/`/sendrgb` — rgb-lib broadcasts before writing its
  bookkeeping, and every post-broadcast failure surfaces as a 500, so the transaction may
  already be on the network — the row is marked `ambiguous`, the debit stands, and
  same-key retries answer 409 `WITHDRAWAL_UNRESOLVED`. The operator must check the node
  (`/listtransactions`, `/listtransfers`) for a matching broadcast and then, in the
  gateway SQLite, either mark the row `sent` with its txid or mark it `failed` and post
  a compensating `refund` ledger entry. There is no admin API for this yet.
- **Unattributable RGB deposits stay pending.** If a settled RGB transfer for a deposit
  target carries no fungible assignment, the watcher cannot tell what was received and
  leaves the intent pending with a warning rather than crediting the declared amount
  (which would mint ledger units the node may not hold — RGB credits are not capped).
